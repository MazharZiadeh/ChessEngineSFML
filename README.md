Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FoveaSFML is an open-source C++ project utilizing the SFML library to implement a dynamic rendering technique that mimics the human eye's focus behavior.
The project aims to demonstrate the concept of foveated rendering, where visual acuity is higher at the center of the view and decreases towards the periphery.

Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic Foveated Rendering: The intensity of each square in the grid is determined by its distance from the mouse position, simulating the concept of foveated rendering.

Toggle Full Rendering: Press the 'P' key to toggle between rendering the entire grid without foveated rendering and rendering with dynamic intensity adjustments.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

C++ compiler
SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move the mouse to control the focus point on the grid.
Press the 'P' key to toggle between rendering the entire grid and dynamic foveated rendering.
